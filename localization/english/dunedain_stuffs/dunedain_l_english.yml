 faith_adunaic_faithful_desc:0 "[Glossary('Anâm nakhô Bârazra sakalada — phazagada, magada, azarada — katha gimilî nâluthôr.', 'gimils_pledge_gloss' )]\n\nThus spoke [gimilziran|E], upon his landing in [middleearth|E] after the [akallabeth|E], and so was the High Kingdom of [thanihazad|E] borne from his ships and the colonies of the [sevenlands|E]. \n\nOr at least, this was the ambition of [gimilziran|E].\n\nBatân an-Êru (The Path of Êru) is a faith of the [faithful|E], a continuation of ancient [numenorean|E] tradition and the teachings once bestowed by the [highelves|E]. Established in the wake of the short-lived conquests of the [faithful|E] [gimilziran|E], it was conceived as a means to preserve stability within his realm by syncretizing his [faithful|E] beliefs with the beliefs of the local [kingsmen|E] population. Unlike their northern [faithful|E] brethren, the Batân an-Êru incorporates some aspects of [kingsmen|E] philosophy into their doctrine, most notably the idea of the [adunaic|E] divine mandate to rule, while remaining rooted in the central truths of [faithful|E] ideals. The Batân an-Êru continues on the legacy of the [numenoreans|E] original intent, coming as teachers and friends to the Men of [middleearth|E].\n\nToday, the followers of Batân an-Êru are scattered and few. In the wake of [gimilziran|E]'s failed grasp for empire, only his heirs and a small, underground circle remain. Yet those who still walk the Path do so with iron resolve. Their faith is fierce, unyielding where others bend, and they would gladly take up arms to preserve the legacy of the Southern [faithful|E] of [thanihazad|E]."

Believing his life to be a mission in service to [iluvatar|E] and the [valargods|E], Gimilattô sought tirelessly to rekindle the light of [eru|E] among those who had turned away. When the Great Armament was summoned, he defied Ar-Pharazôn’s command and fled to Nindamas, where he secretly prepared ships. Warned by his friend [elendil|E] of Amandil’s vision of the [downfallofnumenor|E], Gimilattô and his sons narrowly escaped the cataclysm in a small fleet of vessels carrying their followers. He made landfall in Mispír, ancestral seat of his house, whose forebears once ruled Zimrathâni. \n\nFrom this refuge, he launched his campaign of conquest. Rallying the survivors of [numenor|E], Gimilattô rapidly took control of the Kingdom of Zimrathâni, establishing it as the heart of his new realm. On the outskirts of Mispír, he began constructing a grand palace, envisioning it as the core of a city that would mirror the lost beauty of Andúnië. Declaring himself High King of [thanihazad|E], he demanded fealty from the lords of the [sevenlands|E] and called upon them to renounce the ways of the [kingsmen|E]. This bold proclamation, however, proved his undoing. The nascent [balan_lai|E], viewing Gimilattô as both a heretic and existential threat, launched a full-scale invasion. A simultaneous uprising of native [kingsmen|E] shattered his fragile hold on power. Within just a century, Gimilattô’s dream lay in ruins. He and his son Izinduzôr fell in the bloody Battle of Tharazârûl, ending his short-lived reign. Though his grandson, Adûnafazor, attempted to rekindle the flame of his legacy, he too perished in battle a few years later. Thus the vision of a [faithful|E] [thanihazad|E] was extinguished forever. The war was a total loss, and Gimilattô, along with his son and grandson, were laid to rest in a hidden tomb deep beneath the Gimilzîr Palace."

 ##Nicknames
